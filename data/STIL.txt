/DEMOS/0-9/128_Byte_Blues_BASIC.sid
COMMENT: "When I first had a look at the 512b/1k Tiny SID compo, I thought it'd
         be a great way to get back into doing some assembly language on the
         C=64 (which I haven't done for a long time). I spent a fair amount of
         time thinking of the best way to reduce the size and decided that one
         of the best ways would be to really challenge myself and to squeeze
         some music out of 128 bytes just for fun.
         I really wanted to feature the nature of the C=64, so I thought about
         several ways to best store the note and instrument data. After a few
         sketches, I found that I seemed to be wasting a lot of space trying to
         store both the note and duration data, so I decided that the best way
         would be to derive the notes and durations directly from the C=64
         memory and just index into a basic blues scale and generate some
         music. It took a bit of playing around with techniques, but I found
         that utilizing individual bits to step up or down within the scale
         generated the most musical results. Somewhat of a 1-bit DPCM technique
         except for successive music notes in a scale instead of successive
         samples. So, the code basically cycles through the bits which are
         displayed in the screen memory and uses them to generate the notes.
         The note duration is set by combining the jiffy clock and the cursor
         countdown to give some flex to the tempo. I found that staying in one
         note sequence was boring, so I made it step through two blues scales.
         I tried to squeeze out more space by removing the low byte of the
         frequency but found that it either made the music too out of tune or
         too high in pitch. I also attempted to add a second voice, but ran out
         of space. I really liked the idea of adding something to watch while
         it's playing, so the colours change as it is reading through the bytes
         of screen memory. Rolling the bits of screen memory had the additional
         benefit that the bytes would return to their original form after
         passing over them eight times when the sequence repeats. Since the
         tempo is partially derived from the cursor blink, it is possible to
         change the tempo while moving the cursor. The sequence of notes can
         also be modified by typing in the upper portion of the screen.
         It should sound fine on any C=64 (NTSC/PAL), SID (6581/8580) or good
         emulator (VICE, PowerPC etc..). I've had great fun working on this
         piece and hope others have fun listening and playing around with it as
         well." (Freaky DNA)

         first music disk was completely broken when it arrived, so I recovered
         all that I could (almost) hear and composed the full tunes from the
         beginning. When I got the second disk, I realised that the tunes I
         modified, were not composed for the game parts I used them in.
         Moreover, they told me that my compositions were a lot better than
         his!!! Only the final track, the one that plays during the end titles
         (tune #6), remained untouched. Furthermore, I didn't write about this
         on the title screen, since actually the basic sound was created by
         Michael anyway." (info comes from an interview at www.retrogaming.it)

         that there are 4 different versions of the same tune. This was because
         we couldn't decide whether to create a 'clean' version of the tune or
         an auto of tune version to more closely copy the Spectrum version.
         We opted for a selection!" (Chris Lancaster)

COMMENT: This is a remix of /MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid
         In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after
         Coco Intro was made popular in the Papillion's crack intro, he claims
         that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version
         of the tune (this sid). He explains how he had made the music two
         years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar.
         While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which
         had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. About two
         months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions' intro and no credit
         was given to van Santen. See /MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid
         for more details.

         OPL3 music in it, so naturally I did a SID mix. The one song missing
         is "It," the ending theme. This is because the timing was so totally
         screwed up that I couldn't make head or tail of it. Oh well. BTW, the
         song names here are the filenames minus the .ddt extension. P.S. If
         anyone wants to attempt a C=64 port of Jill (not outside the realm of
         possibility, in my opinion,) feel free to use this. The sample channel
         could be used for playing the game sounds." (JA)

          version was BAD, and the only other SID author who took a stab at
          it was Jesper Olsen. (Some guy did the Atari version, but that
          sucked compared to the arcade/64 version.) So I made my own remix.
          I added some other parts to it, basically with a nicer drum track
          and another voice added onto the bassline. Actually, this started
          out as a Protracker MOD, but I just HAD to do a SID version of

COMMENT: "I can tell you that the Lambada tune, used in our demo's/openings are
         from me. At that time I hadn't any player and I didn't want to spend
         too much time in making one. I ripped the 20CC player by analyzing the
         code in assembler. Then I programmed the codeblocks myself to get the
         Lambada tune right. I laughed when 20CC found out that their player
         was used and Falco Paul or Edwin van Santen hadn't made that tune
         earlier!!! They accused me of ripping routines etc. etc. Well.. they
         were right, I never claimed that it was my player but I merged my
         Lambada tune blocks via assembler into their old music blocks (I
         overwrote it). The funniest thing was that the Lambada tune from me
         was very populair at that time. When 20CC heard it they made their own
         Lambada tune, hehehehe..." (Patrick Peters)

COMMENT: "I had a tight deadline to write a tune for the Forever 2014 party,
         although I was too busy working on other things, including Honey Bee.
         This sound track is a trance style tune, inspired by the Trance
         Sector loading tune. I tried to immitate some of the instruments that
         were used in Goat Tracker, in DMC V5.0+, but the result turned out
         completely different. This tune made it to 11th out 12th place at
         Forever 2014 party. Best heard on a C64C with 8580 SID :)" (RB)

         of Blue Angel by Magic Bytes software, but with some improvisation which
         I added to the tune. I don't feel all that comfortable using Goat
         Tracker to make new sounds, because it is more difficult to get the
         pulse rate and vibrato right. Although this tune sounds cool, the

         little and use it for the disk menu of The Last Amazon Trilogy by

         lead in this tune much, but I entered the tune to the compo anyway.
         And blew it as always." (RB)

COMMENT: "A space atmospheric disco/dance/trance style of tune, done for the
         Oxyron party, but for some reason, as well as the Oxyron Party, this
         tune got released at the KBIT party as well. Seems to be the case
         where I clicked on the wrong link and emailed it to the wrong place,
         then afterwards did a fixed disk and resent it through the correct
         address. Later on in the year, this great piece of music got used as
         the loading music for Escape from Arth, when I was mastering the tape
         for the game." (RB)

COMMENT: "A trance style tune which I came up with as my latest weapon for the
         Forever 5 party. The beginning of the song may sort of familiar.
         You'll be thinking that this track could be a BBE cover (Seven Days
         and One Weekend), but it is actually not. This track is one of my
         very own compositions, which I hoped would do really well at the
         party. It came 5th Place, which was pretty good :)" (RB)

         later on in 2009, I repaired the instruments so that they would sound
         much better. The song made it 4th place out of 4. There were only 5
         entries, and this song shared the same place as another SID composer."

/MUSICIANS/B/Biasillo_Gary/Joe_Blade.sid
COMMENT: "I was thrown into the deep end with this. I had three weeks to
         produce the music and sound effects for the C64, Spectrum, and
         Amstrad versions, which included time to write a music driver for the
         C64. It was a good learning experience but I wish I had more time to
         work on the tunes as most of my efforts went into writing the software.
         I remember listening to the music form The Last Ninja and Wizball at
         that time, trying to figure out how they created the sounds so I could
         write my music driver. Martin Galway later told me how he created the
         high pitched wooden block 'pop' sound, which was achieved by running
         the driver at 240Hz." (GB)

/MUSICIANS/B/Biasillo_Gary/Slayer.sid
COMMENT: "I programmed and produced the music and sound effects for this game
         which was the first for the company I set up with my friend Mike
         Williams called Imperial Software. I had learned a lot of techniques
         from the talented guys at Ocean and put them to work in this game.
         32 sprite multiplexing, near full-screen colour scrolling, and sampled
         sounds." (GB)

         and Amstrad versions. Jonathan Dunn handled the 48k Spectrum version
         which was a completely different set of tunes. I really enjoyed
         working on this. Paulie Hughes wrote a new C64 driver as Martin had
         just left Ocean, and nobody could understand how to use his driver."

/MUSICIANS/B/Bjerregaard_Johannes/Thunderforce.sid
COMMENT: "I wrote most of Thunderforce together with my highschool friend Peter
         Uhd Jespsen. The game was originally written for the Danish company
         called Keleline. Peter was a big fan of Depeche Mode and had most of
         their records. Therefore we wanted to get some tunes from DM in the
         game. Keleline wrote to DM and first got a yes, but then the group
         decided no. At least that was the story we were told, but I think,
         that the director of the company cheated us. Somewhere out there is a
         small demo, which have the five tunes in it."

  TITLE: Mystified [from the Amiga MOD module]
 ARTIST: Jogeir Liljedahl
COMMENT: Prior to public release, GRG believed this tune was originally done on
         the Amiga by Liljedahl. According to GRG, when fellow countryman Geir
         Tjelta heard the SID, Tjelta informed GRG that he thought the original
         was actually done by Bug (Stein Erik Giske) rather than Liljedahl.
         Tjelta also informed GRG that Bug passed away in 1992 thus giving GRG
         inspiration to rename the tune before releasing publicly. Unfortunately
         Tjelta's credit information was incorrect, however Tjelta does not
         recall giving GRG incorrect credits perhaps suggesting there was a
         miscommunication between the two. Another theory is that there may
         have been confusion between Jogeir's "Mystified" and one of Bug's
         tunes named "Slider" where the first few notes are similar but indeed
         the two tunes are very different. Reflecting back, Jogeir Liljedahl, a
         friend and group member of the late Bug, adds the following: "When it
         comes to Mystified, it's 100% my original tune. I haven't even thought
         about the similarities to Bug's Slider tune, but the 5-6 first notes
         of the song are similar to Mystified. But it's a completely different
         song of course. Either me or Bug noticed that back then, and Bug was
         a huge fan of Mystified, since he was among the first to hear the song
         (along with Olav Rasmus Vorren aka Shorty)."

COMMENT: "'Last Flight' is the song about a person which is taking drugs. It
         is a sad story for both the family to the user, and the user itself,
         which later in the song dies, it's the user's last flight. The family
         which stands back with their dead son or daughter is so unhappy and
         sad that they don't know anything anymore. They're feeling a huge
         emptyness inside, they only wish their child back again, staying
         alive. But that will never happen... The last few minutes when the
         child was alive, it dreamed about a sky of marvelous and wonderful
         things flying all around. The longer it lasted the longer away this
         person was to all real things we know here on earth. This child, so
         young, has left the world. Not alive anymore. Doesn't exist, only the
         body left for the family to bury and their memories to keep. Why do
         some want to legalize it?" (KN)

         I can recall the work of XTD and Jester. Having a look on the info
         part inside the the tune I realized we aparently must have followed
         the legal situation in Poland of those years, where actually you could
         legally buy pirated copies of commercial records! Why is that? Well,
         the info says (C)1994 Caution, (C)1995 Amorphis but actually the tune
         doesn't belong to any of these groups, right? It is a mix of
         originally someone's else work. The (C) sign there is merely just an
         indication of what groups released, or used this tune. It was meant
         firstly to be used in 1994 in a Caution production but used only in
         1995 in the music collection by our group Amorphis." (MK)

COMMENT: All of these tunes have been confirmed by Brennan to be his.
         The HVSC team via their sources have checked all the original credits
         and found that most of the tunes that were supposedly done by Greg
         Holland were in fact made by Neil Brennan. For most of the games Greg
         Holland was the graphic artist rather than the composer. The HVSC Crew
         also has confirmation of this fact from a senior employee of Beam
         Software, who was on Melbourne House's main programming team at the
         time. Brennan's own comments are denoted (NB).
         "The only musician I knew at Melbourne House pre-me (I think I started
         in 1983) was Adrian Pertout. A guy named Gavin Anderson (I think) came
         after me, but I lost contact with that company fairly quickly, so I'm
         a pretty poor source of information." (NB)

         "Fred Milgrom (founder of MH) gave me heaps of latitude, for which I

COMMENT: This tune won both the jury and audience voting of the www.c64.sk

(#1)
COMMENT: "This is the version that was fixed for real C64s after the compo.
         The snare sound of the original one is quite silent on a real 6581.
         Due to differences with how high cutoff is handled, this one
         doesn't sound quite right on emulation." (LÖ)
(#2)
COMMENT: "This is the original compo version, but the snare is quite silent

         and tracked within  hours on january, 23rd. This is a kind of jazz
         tune, it's not my style ya know, but I felt like doing a tune like
         this because lots a people like it. Therefore I added sum of my music
         style to the tune, that's why it sounds a bit techno like.. Try to
         enjoy this tune with a stereo, you'll like it I guess.. By the way
         remember that all C128 computers have a different filter set on their
         sid chips,so the music sounds a bit different than on normal C64
         computers, you'll hear the difference on the bass, the filters doesn't
         open theirselves so much on C128! But who the fuck cares, this music
         runs on all computers, that's what counts! [...]"

         for £600. When we delivered they turned around and said, ahh yes but

COMMENT: "When I was interviewed by Brian Wilcox at Elite for a job they sent
         me home with a little task to prove that I had some computer and
         progamming skills. The task was to make the Oric Atmos computer I had
         at home play the theme tune to Airwolf. Over the weekend I managed to
         get the tune playing using a very simple assembler that I had written
         in basic. As a result I got the job at Elite and the first thing they
         had me doing was programming the Airwolf tune on the C64 as they were
         doing a game based on the TV show. After this I found myself doing
         music all the time and that is how I got started." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Airwolf_II.sid
COMMENT: Heavily inspired by Harold Faltermeyer's Axel F.
         "This is a rather peculiar tune, I can't remember anything about this

         knowing elite). The tune sounds vaguely Egyptian or Arabic." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Island.sid
COMMENT: "I never saw this game, I received a phone call and was asked to do
         the music. I had a feeling though that the game might be a bit like
         Commando so I did a tune that was kind of inspired by Rob Hubbard's
         music for that game. Of course it's nowhere near as good as maestro
         Rob's tune but it's certainly not the worst tune I ever did." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Battle_Ships.sid
COMMENT: "This game was based on the well known board game. Tune 2 is a weird
         victory ditty that was composed by my brother. Tune 3 I think is the
         highscore music and tune 4 is the ingame music, just a 2 channel
         ambient track which left 1 channel for sfx. Tune 5 seems to be corrupt
         and out of sync for some reason but was meant to be used for action
         parts of the game." (MC)

/MUSICIANS/C/Cooksey_Mark/Bomb_Jack.sid

         like this all the time in the early days, I think the legislation at
         the time didn't cover computer based music, that situation didn't last
         very long though and we then needed to do original compositions
         (supposedly). Only tune 2 is from the original arcade machine.

         Lady Madonna by the Beatles." (MC)

COMMENT: "Without doubt the game which is most closely associated with me.
         The highscore tune (1) is a copy from the original arcade machine.
         However, having listened to the in game tune which was a complicated
         harpsichord tune using lots of channels, I decided to compose my own
         ghostly tune. Again the tune is not completely original using elements
         from several sources including Chopin and other bizarre sources (my
         mom's old organ vinyl records from the 70's). I'm still mystified
         about why I went for that strange percussion but it seems to work

         the 20th Cent Fox HQ in London. We had a private pre-release screening
         of Gremlins II in their mini cinema, kitted out with surround sound.
         The computer press were invited and Steve Wilcox gave a talk before
         the film was screened. After wards we went to a Thai restaurant but
         being a potatoes & gravy man I passed on the food and hot footed it
         home. Worryingly, listening to the music I'm not 100% sure if I did it
         or not. I think I did cause certain elements sound like my music but
         the highscore tune (No 6) sounds far too good. Perhaps by 1990 I had
         improved the music player routine and decided to do a good job for
         this game." (MC)

         is a bit on the weird side but I thought that it went quite well with
         the fairly slow pace of the cycling round the streets bit of the game.
         On the coin op there were a number of speech samples and some of these

         that day. Tune 1 is the highscore tune and I have done a full version
         of this on keyboard etc. The people who developed this game had a
         pokey little room on the upper story of a computer store in Walsall

COMMENT: All tunes but tune #4 are based on the arcade version.
         "I used to love playing this arcade machine when we had got it at the
         offices at Elite, those Easter Island type stone heads that flew
         towards you were especially effective. The original in game tune had
         got a memorable melody so I decided to stick to it. The middle section
         of my version may be original though, the tune plays a little faster
         than on the arcade machine. This was due to the fact that my routine
         didn't contain a fractional timer at that point. Speeds were
         determined by the shortest note length which could be 1,2,3 or 4 etc.
         The speed differences were thus 100%, 50,33% etc. with no in between
         values. The rest of the tunes in the set are original compositions I
         think, maybe tune 2 was close to the arcade version." (MC)

         Tune 1 has a kind of John Carpenter feel, tune 2 is a Bach influenced
         piece, tune 3 is a very echoey menacing tune. Tune 4 is an action type
         tune, tune 5 is a durge, tune 6 is game over, tune 7 is a dancey

         for this game but it ended up sounding a little weak and slow.
         This was probably the last C64 music I did before I moved on to other
         platforms such as the original gameboy and SNES etc. The person who
         used to pay the cheques out at Arc used to make me jump through hoops

         "Shamefully, this was written at the time when SID emulation was not
         at its best. There is a cymbal-crash sound that I expected to play
         with a phase-shifting effect, not knowing at the time that you need to
         set the waveforms to $91-$9f and then do a hard-restart with $09 on
         the next frame. Due to this lack of knowledge, this can't be heard
         when played on a real C64 (with 2 SID chips) or on recent versions of
         Vice. A pity, as I don't have the source module any more. :(" (OC)

         In the beginning DRAX did the soundtrack for the game while I made
         the sfx. At some time during the production of the music, DRAX thought
         he could use some help and I agreed to do some of the music. While the
         music and sfx was done in 1990, the game was put on ice by the
         Austrian guys as they became tired of it. Some years later they
         revived the project, finished it, and sold it to a German software
         house under the new name, "Hermetic"". (JCH)

  TITLE: Rubicon, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Jeroen Tel
COMMENT: "They wanted a title-theme for Shock Magazine, and gave me the first
         issue. There was a song in there, and I had no clue what it really
         was but thought it captured the feel of the entire magazine. So I
         simply made a cover of it, Danko style. I never had any hangups about
         having to do it all, music is all about sharing and developing ideas
         together in order to reach higher grounds. The chords aren't
         identical to Jeroen's version, in fact we had a little thing over
         that at a party in Oslo back in '94 or so. We hung over a keyboard
         and I played the chords my style, and he went like 'No! It's like
         THIS!' and I said 'Well, I want it THIS way!'. *grin* One of the guys
         at the party leaned over to me and whispered that he in fact
         preferred my version of the track. *smirk* Jeroen superimposed a sus2
         chord throughout the progression until it folds back to the tonic,
         where the sus2 becomes a m7. It's a nice move, one that I personally
         use quite a lot myself. But this time around I expanded the
         progression to plain chords following the bassline.
         After I had done the tune I found out that it was from Rubicon, but
         to me it doesn't matter.
         Later on I made a remix of it, called it Schizomix, with weird
         sounds. Because Rubicon had been a double-speed song, or something
         similar, I wanted to make weird and similar sounds but in a single-
         speed player. And that's all it was, a messed up version of my first
         cover so to speak." (TD)

COMMENT: The corresponding game for this music was never released for the

         platforms in 1990. Deenen's C64 efforts weren't in vain, however, as
         he was able to reuse much of the music and began a new phase of his
         career. In a 2006 posting, Deenen's reflects: "If I hadn't done the
         C64 Lord of the Rings stuff I wouldn't have gotten my first
         'full-time' job in the US. I'd probably be struggling in Holland now
         trying to make it as a programmer or music guy."

COMMENT: This is a worktune found in Charles Deenen workdisks, made in 1988.
         "This was made for fun. I do recall a bit of a "too strong"
         inspiritation from a Rambo soundtrack. Something that was done in like
         an hour or so, probably to test out a new pulse-width routine, hence
         why it sounds so unpolished and unfinished." (CD)

/MUSICIANS/D/Detert_Thomas/Gordian_Tomb.sid
COMMENT: The original release has a protection which overlaps a fraction of
         the music data, causing dirty sounds in subtune #1 (most notably, the
         bass). The game was also released without protection and with correct
         data, which is present in this rip.
         "After we got the contract [for Gordian Tomb] with a good value of
         money, we discussed how to divide it to the people. This was a mess.
         We at least lost some days of programming. Michael [Detert] was
         menacing with a dropout if Thomas didn't compose the music. So I
         thought ok, we are a team and I am busy with programming - why not?
         But then we couldn't unite about the amount of money. Thomas should
         get the twice of a normal level for a salary. If I had been a better
         businessman these days I had done everything by myself, but at least
         we had a great time and a lot of fun. And the teamwork was always
         accurate. Finally Thomas had known that the salary was overdrawn and
         he repaid every dollar with the longest music ever [32:06 minutes] on
         commodore 64." (Info from Markus Schneider).

COMMENT: MC Hammer used the original tune as the main rhythm for "U Can't
         Touch This!"
         While the the Amiga versions of Demonware's games The Power and Ooops
         Up had digitracks of the Snap songs, Detert was instructed NOT to do a
         cover of The Power by Snap for this soundtrack, obviously the guys at
         Snap meanwhile changed their minds about their agreement with
         Demonware.
         The C64 version of Ooops Up was never finished, early soundtrack
         versions done by Rodney Balai did feature a cover of the Snap song
         though. (see /MUSICIANS/A/Audial_Arts/Balai_Rodney/Ooops_Up.sid)

         the version of the Biene Maja tune where there are these cheesy sound
         fx inside from the bees falling down. :-) This version of the tune
         also gets out of sync, but that is how it was supposed to do: as

         withdrew the game and re-released it with a different non-offending
         tune #2. This is in /MUSICIANS/D/Dunn_David/Chiller_v2.sid

         from Megastyle that they wanted me as a member making tons of
         intro/demo-tunes. I got their editor but they never used ANY of my
         music. Their player was based on JB/MON's Stormlord tunes. I decided
         to join my local friends in the Norway/Finland/Germany-based group
         Antimon instead. Most of my music had been used by them anyway. This
         is like most of my tunes in in C-minor and rather sad sounding. I put
         a lot of work into this one (and not quitting early like usually do).

COMMENT: "I had just got hold of Rockmonitor2 in 1987 and slowly tried out what
         it had. This tune still contains lots of music from the default-tune
         and probably all the default sounds as it took months before I learned
         how to make my own sounds. It has no drumsamples here either because
         that took a while to learn too. I converted it to Soundmonitor to save

         This one voice digi tune is a companion to the bizarre movie "Xmas
         Chortles" featuring Jason Mackenzie (Kenz) and friends in really manic
         scenes and behaviour, including setting fire to a Spectrum, re-making
         a Pepsi ad, lots of playing C64 Games and strange footage. The voice
         of Kenz is heard in the "Xmas Chortles" and "Merry Christmas" samples.
         According to Feekzoid, this tune was never supposed to be released.

COMMENT: "I wrote it around '84 or '85 as a demo for my music editor called
         'Synth'. I was going to University of Waterloo at the time and just
         gave it to a friend of mine... didn't even bother to put my name on
         the thing. Anyway it soon started cropping up all over the place.
         I never made any sequels with music, although there was something with
         annoying sound effects done in the same style as Synth Sample that I
         posted in the beginning of 1994. So any music you see that looks like
         a sequel or has graphics added was done by someone else.
         Anyway the computer bust of 85/86(?) hit and Synth was never marketed.
         I had been negotiating with a software company but they went out of
         business. By that time I was working on a new version of Synth that
         was a sequencer program for Midi instruments (called MSS), and had
         joined my first band. I've been in a couple other bands since then,
         the last one was called SugarPush and we came close to getting signed
         (but then broke up [...]). So I guess you can credit that little
         program with launching my musical career..." (GF)

COMMENT: This is the very first published tune on the C64 that used samples.
         "Q: How did you get involved with using sampled sounds?
         MG: I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone
         else's code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package
         called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to
         include samples in a piece of music. [...] Never would I claim to have
         invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I
         couldn't really figure out where they got the sample data, just that
         they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own
         drum sample sounds in realtime - which is the flatulence stuff that
         shipped in 'Arkanoid'. [...] After the project was in the shops I
         gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own
         custom version of the tune. The one that's in the shops is kind of a
         collage of farts & burps, don't you think? [...] Later I was able to
         acquire some proper drum samples and by 'Game Over' it got quite
         sophisticated." (MG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Miami_Vice.sid
COMMENT: "The Miami Vice game was a very quick job. I had been handed 'Miami
         Vice' and 'Highlander' because the outside development team working on
         it hadn't worked out who was going to do the sound (notice those games
         have little or no sound-effects), so I did my best in a very short
         time. I [...] picked 'The Chase' and the 'Main Theme' as the two tunes
         I would do. We had settled on two modes for the game - in your car and
         out of it I think. (Or maybe it was in the game and out of it, I can't
         remember.) I started on 'The Chase' and if you listen to the first few
         seconds of that you can hear the basis of that super-filter-echo tune
         that is so cool. I recall David Collier was sitting in the office with
         me while I was working on it. But while messing with it while everyone
         else was at lunch, I came across this cool sound. I added to it and
         added to it, and when we applied the non-sync'd filter sweep we both
         flipped out! I decided to abandon the conversion of that tune and
         simply go with the cool sounds I had stumbled upon. When the guys came
         back from lunch and listened to it they swore that there was a
         cassette deck connected somewhere and it wasn't the C64 playing it!
         Such a sound had not been heard before by any of us out of the C64. So
         I extended it and turned it into this tripping-out 11-minute piece.
         The main theme itself... I simply did my best with no drums (Rob
         Hubbard's strength). I think my strength with guitar solos helped pull
         it off. Both of those problematic games benefited from my music,
         actually, and the Ocean management were very relieved
         (understatement)." (MG)

         (Cyclone would have used it, for example, but it was never released by
         Ocean). The delay at 02:03.00 really is supposed to be a delay of 4
         beats." (MG)
         Because of the delay Martin mentioned at 2:03, it led a lot of people
         to believe later parts of the tune went out of synch and it was
         bugged. However, this has been confirmed as intentional. This version
         was known to have been used in Hyper Sports and Transformers.

         for every game - that was my plan.  However, I was running out of time
         on projects and in the case of C.B. I simply reworked an older piece.
         After that I _really_ didn't have time to mess with it, and it stuck
         in universal use. Rambo was the only one that got its own loading
         music as part of this plan." (MG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Parallax.sid
COMMENT: Before starting on this game Galway bought Rendez-Vous (by Jean Michel

         didn't get repaired for 2 months, during which time Martin worked on
         Parallax, without realizing that Rendez-Vous was unconsciously
         creeping into the music. He realized it only after he played the album
         again after the game was already shipped.
         "[Parallax] was 11 minutes long, certainly my longest at the time. I
         took my development gear home to work on it for a week or two. I just
         said to myself 'OK, it's going to be this mega-tune, so the intro has
         to be mega'. The intro took up two-thirds of the tune! I actually got
         bored with it, and stuck that silly melody on the end which doesn't
         really match. Going back I would have made it less melodic. I wanted
         to reflect the gigantic visual proportions represented by the parallax
         effect in the game so that's why it has an 'epic' feel."(MG)

         music 79%, my worst score since 'Roland's Rat Race', so you can
         imagine my disappointment. One of the other tunes was easy, that's the
         simple ballad melody 'come and follow me', which I was able to arrange
         quite successfully. The other one was a nightmare since it's the tune
         right from the beginning of the movie with all the robotic short notes
         & arpeggios. The tune just built up so massive that the poor C64 was
         short of notes by about 30 seconds into it, so I had to fudge the end
         a bit and make it repeat, basically." (MG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Galway_Martin/Street_Hawk.sid
COMMENT: "The game was re-assigned in early 1986 to Comic Bakery's programmer
         Colin Gresty and artist Steve Wahid, and they enthusiastically got
         to work on it, coming up with an all-new approach with nicer
         graphics - more like the early Grand Theft Auto games (top-down viewed
         from a chase camera).  However it was very slow going for those guys
         and while the art/design was done by mid-1987, Colin was still
         finishing the programming towards the end of that year, say, about
         September.  Ocean, who'd been advertising the game in magazines for
         months, were very annoyed by this delay and were not going to make
         their intended profit. (Perhaps their option window to publish the
         game was expiring too, who knows?) So they cancelled the project when
         it was at the 99%-complete stage and fired Colin." (MG)

COMMENT: "Of course I have recollections... where do I begin... are you
         sitting comfortably?  The fact that there are two versions of
         Streethawk music is part of the whole mystery of Streethawk, really.
         It started in 1985 and was programmed by Mike Webb, who'd just come
         off Amstrad Kong Strikes Back. Lateral thinker that he is, he had a
         rather unique design going (a sideways scrolling platform-jumping
         design which is probably now lost forever), and I think he went on
         holiday for a week or two, and when he came back they decided to have
         him do another project - or, he left to join forces with Richard Kay
         at Software Creations. (He definitely did the latter, but I can't

         music without doing anything else.  I did it some time in the summer
         of 1985, so it sonically resembles Cyclone/Helicopter Jagd and
         Neverending Story.  There was no filter technology in my driver. All
         that Ocean had as reference for the show was an NTSC tape of the pilot
         episode of the series, which we were able to play on our futuristic,
         highly-technical NTSC-playback VCR/TV. By listening to the opening &
         closing credits, I put the tune in by ear." (MG)

COMMENT: "I tried to create this feeling of a massive behemoth robot monster on
         its way to destroy you. Thus the marching beat and the minor chords
         and stark tones. I had to stick in the inevitable jamming solo towards
         the end of course. I was starting to face the glass ceiling imposed by
         the filter on the C64. While my particular SID sounded great, others
         were not like it at all and the solos were almost inaudible! At the
         other extreme the new C64C's were coming out and this filter
         unreliability had been fixed as part of a silicon revision. BUT the
         filters were way too open all the time and you could hardly hear any
         filtering! This caused the filtered note to come out a lot louder than
         it should have and 'stick out' rather unattractively. So I developed a
         'filter adjustment' parameter for my music program which would allow
         the customer to control this filter unreliability and get their
         particular machine to sound cool. But David Collier never put it in
         the options screen. (DOH!) There's always something wrong, eh?" (MG)

         When I returned to Ocean I got on with some other things, all the time
         worrying about this unfinished tune. Finally I slapped something on
         the end of it. I knew I could never top the first part, that's what
         the problem was. In my mind the second part of the tune is pretty lame
         compared with the first part. But for some people it represents the
         mysterious, magical, unconventional aspect of 'Wizball' so it fits in
         some ways. But you can tell it's not really like the other music in
         the game, which was primarily developed when I was with the Sensi

         note (my favourite beginning note of course, G - almost everything I
         do is in G). So I plugged in this echoing waveform thing and let it
         rip. The tune isn't particularly Chinese sounding, but I was working
         on producing that 'perfect melody', the one you'd be humming all day,
         you know. That was a phase I went through. [...] The sound I was
         converting from was itself a conversion of the arcade cabinet, which I
         have NEVER SEEN. It sounded like it was a lame conversion too, so I
         easily did a better sounding version. (The MSX's music only used two

  TITLE: Tension [from the game YS]
 ARTIST: Yuzo Koshiro
COMMENT: "The original is a chiptune I found in the '.m' format, which is
         compiled MML code (Music Markup Language). It was, and still is, a
         very popular way to compose computer music in Japan. The tunes are
         written in a text editor and then compiled and maybe processed
         using one or several utilities. Anyway, I thought it was cool and
         decided to make my own version of it." (LG)

         Bjerregaard_Johannes, Laxity, and Link.
         "In 1990, I produced Deliverance: Stormlord II, my last ever SID track.
         Ironically, it was for Hewson Consultants, who folded soon after. It
         was time for a change, and by then I was starting to release dance
         music for club play. It's an alright piece of work, though I think the
         sounds were probably better than some of the tunes. I've just reworked
         it for a Kickstarter project and it sounds so much better now." (MDG)

COMMENT: "Driller, which I did for Incentive Software, was another big turning
         point for me. They wanted something long and epic, not short and
         repetitive. Concept-wise, it was the perfect game for me. It was
         exactly the sort of thing I had been waiting to get my teeth into
         musically. It took four weeks to complete, including an almost
         two-week pause in the middle when the Great Storm of 1987 struck the
         UK, leaving us without electricity or heating for about ten or eleven
         days. I can remember walking down our road one dark evening, wondering
         if I would ever get to use the C64 again, and suddenly noticing all the
         neighbours' lights were finally on again. I went straight in, fired up
         the assembler and carried on composing." (MDG)
(#1)

         In the game the tune was synced up to the Keyboard interrupts, speeding
         it up and making it two minutes shorter.

         cover of the victory theme from Escape To Victory, which is a football
         version of The Great Escape. It's a film that my mates and I used to
         enjoy as kids because of the many football stars in it, including Pelé

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Last_Ninja_2.sid
COMMENT: "In 1988, as mentioned, I did The Last Ninja 2 for System 3. I did the
         Central Park tracks first, which was important in order to stamp some
         sort of "sound" on the game. It basically took from mid-January until
         early April to finish. It's about as big a project as you would want to
         undertake, but everything just seemed to work without any real hitches.
         I was given a fairly free hand to produce what I thought would be most
         suitable and luckily, every time I took in new tracks for each level, I
         got the thumbs up. It was a great time for me personally, to suddenly
         be working full time on C64 music. I was almost 18, but I had no real
         worries in the world beyond whether I could afford to buy a better car.
         I think the entire The Last Ninja 2 soundtrack is my proudest
         achievement, especially the Central Park tracks, as they seem to mean
         so much to so many people. The project itself was a pleasure to be part
         of. The whole team involved were probably at the top of their C64 game
         at the time, from John's programming to Hugh's fantastic graphics,
         Tim's storyboarding and of course Mark's overall vision and commitment.
         It's amazing that we're still talking about it nearly 30 years on."

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Professional_BMX_Simulator.sid
COMMENT: "BMX Simulator II, also for Codemasters and also known as Pro BMX, was
         a very quick track to do  it had to be, as it was needed in a hurry.
         It has since taken on a life of its own on the demo scene, though
         apparently, not many people knew it was one of mine." (MDG)
         Later reused in game "Ninja Massacre", (C) 1989 Codemasters.

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Quedex.sid
COMMENT: "Paul Docherty and/or Graham Hunter passed one of my CNet demos on to
         Paul Cooper at Thalamus. They wanted to use it for the loading
         sequence, but it had been written on Soundmonitor. Somehow, they
         managed to get it to play while the game loaded. The in-game tunes
         needed to be written in such a way that if a sound effect played,
         it didn't destroy the music too much. Stavros Fasoulas and Paul Cooper
         drove up to my parents' house where I basically had the top floor of
         a bungalow to myself. Stavros loaded up his game demos and went
         through what was needed. I think it took me about two weeks to do all
         the tunes and FX. Working for such a big name in the industry
         definitely opened up more doors." (MDG)

COMMENT: "On Treasure Island Dizzy, also for Codemasters, the title theme was my
         version of the original Dizzy music, and the in-game tune had a rhythm
         in 12ths with a heavy swing. I liked the arpeggio chords in it. I also
         like the high score tune, for some reason. I later converted these to
         the NES." (MDG)

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Tusker.sid
COMMENT: "Tusker, also for System 3, was an interesting production because I'd
         heard Rob Hubbard create a sound like crickets in the grass or jungle
         on Flash Gordon, so I created a similar sound which was great for the
         general atmosphere on Tusker. The drums and rhythms were also very
         important in this game. There needed to be a tribal sound overall, and
         I think I managed that. I think I spent about four or five weeks on
         this game." (MDG)
(#2)
COMMENT: It may just be a coincidence, but from 2:48 - 3:19 the melody sounds
         identical to a title song in a movie called "Zombie Flesheaters" from
         1979 by Lucio Fulci.

/MUSICIANS/G/Gray_Matt/Vendetta.sid
COMMENT: "In 1989, I did Vendetta for System 3. The first track I did for this
         was a cover of Infected by The The. Paul Docherty introduced me to it
         as a reference, but I took it a little too literally. I had to make a
         lot of use of the filters on this game, to keep the mood. This was
         actually my last game for System 3, sometime around March 1989. I
         think the Maniacs of Noise had rolled into town by then!" (MDG)

         I'm amazed I got any other offers after those two efforts!" (MDG)

COMMENT: Due to many complaints about the voting system done at competition

         decided to enter the competition with a deliberate pathetic tune. His
         goal was to see if his dismal creation could score higher than some of
         the real competitors proving the system was a complete farce. For this
         particular competition, SymMek98, Greatrix's tune rightfully finished
         last.

         "I practiced a lot making sids in the late 1980s but released my
         first tunes in 1990.  After Antti Kangas (Scorpion) finished
         his first music routine for Artline Designs (ALD) we started to
         release "quality-sounds".  Before ALD I was the founder member of
         Contex.  All tunes were composed with an assembler." (AH)

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/ATA.sid
COMMENT: "Released in 1992, made with ALD-player v3.0 which was developed late
         1990. The routine turned out to be the one I used most, though v3.7
         was even ready at the time.
         The tune itself was the first one I was asked to do for a game. ATA
         was a Tetris-clone done by German Lower Level and I don't recall if I
         got paid for the track, but anyway it was liked by the authors and
         apparently many others.
         This must have been the best track I've done if I don't take count on
         my new tunes. I wasn't anymore much into composing that time, I just
         composed as a time-killer. Also a high score track was included." (AH)

 ARTIST: Marius Constant
COMMENT: "My first 'good' song with ALD-player v2.1 and one of the few covers I
         ever did. V2.1 didn't have any pulse data for $41 sounds so therefore
         I just used $11 or $21 to have acceptable melody-sounds.
         I was just playing around with the routine and somehow the Zone-theme
         appeared into my mind, but it's only influenced by the theme and the
         rest of the tune was just an effort of imagination.
         Done in January/February 1990." (AH)

/MUSICIANS/H/Hannula_Antti/B-Ball.sid
COMMENT: "The B-Ball sounds were ordered in the Autumn 92 just after I had

         much as I sent it to my old pals, which I even didn't know if they
         were in the scene anymore or not. The B-Ball track however, never got
         released as the game wasn't sold (I guess). I liked this track a lot
         myself and in fact it was the first time I had to do jingles. The
         player I used was v3.6. B-Ball was the last (finished) track I did
         until now in 1999." (AH)

         participated in Proxy 99 party in Finland, even though I wasn't
         present it won the C64 music competition. Some people were really
         amazed to see a track from me for a long long time. I made the basis
         for it with Fasttracker and this is the way I compose the tunes these
         days. It's not a hard job to 'convert' the into assembler if you just
         make the tunes in a 64-style." (AH)

         bass (LFO/LFO) and the tune was inspired by a band called Rhythmatic.
         Scrap/Genesis Project (ex-Contex) reviewed this tune and commented 'Is

COMMENT: "I can recall quite clearly that I designed the arpeggios with my
         synthesizer and that was all I needed. I also used to create the
         melodies by playing the bass and chorus from C64 and the melody from
         the synth, it was quite easy. However, I should have done longer
         melodies, too often the melody lasted for 16 beats and then I just
         repeated it." (AH)

         The first time I used $11 in arpeggios. I think this tune got its
         right atmosphere right from the beginning. The pulse bassdrum was
         meant to be as a heartbeat, oooh I loved the bass-sound. So simple so
         cool!" (AH)

         and started working on the C64 version. I think they wanted some

         By the time everyone arrived at 8.00am in the morning, I had loaded

/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Delta.sid
COMMENT: "[...] The Delta music loader and ingame music was Gary Liddon's idea.
         [...] He was the producer at Thalamus at the time. He told Rob Hubbard
         to make the ingame music like the 2nd track from Dark Side of the Moon
         by Pink Floyd." (Info from Matt Furniss.)
         "The small jingles are all small clips from Sanxion and Romeo/Juliet
         music. They were all supposed to be for short stingers such as end of
         level, extra life etc..."
         "Delta was based on this minimalist composition technique inspired by
         Glass and a bit of Pink Floyd. It was quite hard to do and required
         some custom code to the driver to do it. The music was tedious to
         debug. The other Delta stuff was more conventional - I quite liked the
         other tunes. Delta was spread over a 2 week period....." (RH)
         According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
         to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
         insane.

COMMENT: "Human Race was a very interesting project. The tunes tried to capture
         some of the feel of the game, evolution etc... One of the tunes was
         also used for an ST game (GoldRunner I think). I only used 2 SID
         voices for all these tunes because I used the other for SFX...... Most
         of the tunes were sketched out on a small keyboard and manuscript
         paper. I used paper to keep track of the basic ideas and arrangement,
         and I still have all the original manuscripts. A lot of the
         manuscripts are not readable because I used to work very fast and
         never updated many of the changes I made. I used to use a machine code
         monitor to edit music data and sound patch data on the file while the
         tune was playing. This allowed me to really fine tune the SID
         parameters for the music." (RH)

         time ran out and they couldn't wait the extra three weeks to finish
         off the music and implement it the way I wanted. So I hacked and
         linked all the different bits together into one long piece." (RH)
         According to Hubbard, Kentilla and Delta were the most complicated one
         to compose, they took the longest time to do and they both drove him
         insane.

         make it sound like more than 1 voice." (RH)
         The Last V8 was the first game released by Mastertronic's new label
         MAD (Mastertronic's Added Dimension). Due to the fact they wanted the
         launch to coincide with the release of the Last V8, the game was rush
         released and therefore unfortunately had a bug, where the
         main theme music (subtune #1) falls out of synch at around the one
         minute mark.  Upon closer investigation, this is due to a mere seven
         bytes of the music player code being incorrect.  This SID has those
         bytes corrected.

         The Commodore 128 disk-only version had different speech samples from
         the Commodore 64 version.  However it still also exhibited the same
         bug with tune #1 (see /MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Last_V8.sid) which

         "MOTR was supposed to be this run around like a madman type music and

         - Part 2 was never released) due to Ocean's Platoon coming out and
         being rather good - it eventually came out in June 1988. Also, copies
         of the game came with a free cassette single of the original Paul

         nothing of whatsoever!
         "OMAHD was [...] Jarre inspired. It was actually based on something I

         cheesy lame music along with it - I didn't want to admit that I did it

/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Thrust.sid
COMMENT: Review copies of this game had a bugged loader which mucked up the

         Julian Rignall (ex-editor of Zzap! 64) takes up the story:
         "I remember the God awful cacophony that was our review copy of
         Thrust's music as though it were still playing. This was the problem:
         the drum sounds worked, but all the other instrument sounds were
         screwed - basically it resulted in this horrible screeching noise
         playing to drums, rather than the cool heavyish sound that was heard
         in the final version of the game. It sounded really harsh and so it
         was duly shot down by us in the review. I remember hearing the
         'proper' version of the game at a later dater and thinking 'ooooops!'.
         After all it was a classic tune (it became one of my faves, indeed)
         and we'd mercilessly beaten it down in the review, which was totally
         unfair. Still, it was good to be able to do a ZZAPback on it and
         remedy the error."

         According to Hülsbeck, though, the game "Bad Cat" was delayed about 3
         months at Rainbow Arts during which time Imagine released their game
         "Arkanoid", containing Martin Galway's sample-like technique.
         "Arkanoid" thus became the first publically available game to feature
         SID music with samples.
         This is a cover from The Flirts's song Passion. The cover starts at
         0:44 with the same bass. At 1:14 you will hear the melody from

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/Gem_X.sid
COMMENT: Gem'X was Hülsbeck's last official C64 production.
         "The original Gem'X was from the Amiga and it's an original game that
         was inspired by some Japanese arcade puzzle games, but I don't remember
         which ones. The music is completely original though." (CH)

COMMENT: This tune, finished in the summer of 1985, was Hülsbeck's first music
         composed for a commercial game, but the release of the game itself
         was delayed until 1986.

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/R-Type.sid
COMMENT: Very interesting story here. Katakis was released in September 1988 by
         Rainbow Arts, however it never got a release in the UK as Activision
         had it cancelled because of similarities to R-Type, to which
         Activision had bought the conversion rights. Activision were getting
         nowhere with their conversion of R-Type and they liked what they saw
         of Katakis, so they hired the same programming team (Manfred Trenz and
         others) to do the C64 conversion. They only got 6 weeks to write the
         conversion, and sadly, it shows. Katakis was eventually altered and
         released as Denaris in 1989. Tunes #2 to #14 all cover of the arcade
         game.

/MUSICIANS/H/Huelsbeck_Chris/Shades_filter_corrected.sid
COMMENT: "When I composed Shades, I had a slightly out of whack filter in my
         C64 and I didn't have the time to cross-check with other C64s. Result
         is that the tune appears too filtered compared to my original
         intention. I released a little program to correct the filter in the
         next magazine edition after the competition. Here is a version that is
         much closer to how it was intended to sound." (CH)

         1989, some time before Jeroen Tel made his first quatro-tune for
         "Invest". However, the idea was not new at that time. In the
         mid-eighties Tony Crowther experimented with quatro players in games
         such as "Zig Zag". My double speed tune, however, used the ordinary v9
         player and was simply called twice a frame.

         ...this is how it was changed to make SilverRock happy. As you can
         hear, the difference is really not that big. Later on during the
         programming of the game, Thomas (the programmer) realized that he
         could not fit all the leveltunes into the game, hence this leveltune
         was the first to go.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hawaii.sid
COMMENT: A very long tune containing one of the longest solo parts I have ever
         done in a C64 tune. The bassline and drums were originally made by
         Morten Sigaard Kristensen, but in the end I "raped" it so much that it
         virtually became my own work. The solo part starts at 01:39. Notice
         how the tune decays in the end - this was very unusual on the C64.

/MUSICIANS/J/JCH/Hexagon_Party.sid
COMMENT: Made FOR that party, not AT it. The tune contains quite a lot of
         harmonic mistakes, something I often made in that period. These were
         often caused by "lazy" transpositions of the bassline sequence -
         instead of creating a new one.

COMMENT: A television quiz program which was made popular by a great Danish

         as a C64 game. The music was composed on the Amiga by an unknown guy.
         "DRAX" was asked to convert the tune for a certain sum of money but,
         as he said himself, he wasn't sure he could convert it so he asked me
         for help. I completed the conversion for the ridiculous sum of money.
         Later, "DRAX" admitted that he didn't complete the conversion because
         he thought the original Amiga music was boring. I must confess that he
         has a point there.

         voices of the ingame tune as I could, to make it sound like many more

COMMENT: A professional software house in Denmark called "SilverRock" gained a

         controlled in a game using telephone buttons. A very new concept which
         soon became enormously popular. During the success of the troll, a
         real musician produced a CD containing a rap hit where Hugo was
         singing using the typical voice which was also used in the game. As
         the game was converted for sales versions from the Amiga to PC and

         long and I put a lot of work into it in april 1989, but today I can
         hear loads of harmonic errors here and there. The game was done for a
         sideways shoot'em up which a couple of totally unknown danish guys was
         making. They soon lost all interest in their game, however. The
         hiscore theme was a conversion of the old Cliff Richard hit
         "Congratulations" done right out my head. I always wanted to make such
         a hiscore tune, because I always thought Rob Hubbard did it all wrong
         when he made "sad" hiscore tunes. It is a sad thing when the game
         ends, but getting a high score is supposed to be a GOOD thing! :)

         metallic. However, I later discovered that this worked differently
         from C64 to C64. On some C64, I had to lock the waveform with $F0,
         where other versions required $F8 to achieve the same effect.

          set, we (Sidder & me) did the first minute, and then Jammer came
          from nowhere and slapped his part at the end of it. Unfortunately,
          we forgot to test the tune on a real machine - and it was crucial,
          because strange filter settings make this one sound COMPLETELY
          BROKEN on C64. The title appears to fit perfectly in this case, I
          think. No wonder it was voted that low: 17th out of 19 at North
          Party 8 in 2003. So, use SIDPlay2/w." (comment by Smalltown Boy)

         incredibly dark, having spent the last week in bed ill, I really
         wanted to go home, or failing that, I wanted someone to take a few
         minutes out of their day to see if I was still alive (okay, so I was
         feeling kind of melodramatic, lol),  This girl promised to hang out
         with me, and then cancelled or forgot every time for weeks straight,
         and I was stupid (read: thinking with my heart instead of my head)
         and didn't want to acknowlage that she was ignoring me...  I was
         losing my mind, and this music represents that.
         The full verse is "Blood, Starlight, Rain like tears, Drink from
         this, and let go the years".  I don't know who penned those words, but
         I dropped the latter half from the title because I promised said girl
         that I would.
         This music was made on an emulator (vice 1.8, and of course I had
         resid turned on :-p).  It was also one of my bigger expermients with
         filters synced from different channels to the one they're targetting.
         If it works at all on a real C64, I'd consider myself very lucky, lol,

         modern music blah blah watever, I forget the details.  Anyhow, around
         2 minutes after I sat down at the editor, it instead became something
         else (I hate it when that happens :-p), which basically amounts to an
         attempt to place what was goes through my mind at the time into sid

COMMENT: "This is the second attempt I made to do this song on the C64, and was
         in fact the song that TFX table variables were created for.  I
         originally tried to do this in sid duzz it in early 1999, but the
         number of arpeggio commands required for the places where there is
         two leads in one channel, and the blips in the drum/bass channel,
         overwelmed that editor.  So I tried in JCH v20g4, where I had managed
         to succed with Sunset Spirals, due to the ability it has to change the
         wavetable from within a song, but this too was not to be, due to the
         limitations of the editor.  So, I started writing a new editor, which
         was specifically designed to handle this situation, by splitting each
         channel into six virtual channels, and using special rules to modulate
         them together.  But this took up a lot of ram and raster time, indeed
         it too so much ram in the editor that I could only store five patterns
         at a time, so this was not to be either.  So Ray introduced me to TFX,
         and I asked him about changing the wave table from within the song,
         but he wouldn't have this, because it would confuse people, but he
         suggested a viable alternative, which is to support variables in the
         wave table, and promised to add this feature asap.  That was January
         2001, but he was too busy to implement them for the next two and a
         half years.  So I started bugging him to just give me the source and
         the bits to build it, and in November 2003,  he did.  So, I put my
         money where my mouth was, and added that feature (and a bunch of
         others which I had been wanting for a long time), and I was _finally_
         able to do a version of this that I happy with.  To anyone else but
         me, this is just another mediocre game tune, but for me it was an
         achievement." (JJ)

COMMENT: "Anyone who played the arcade game much knows that Ben's cover of it
         was a bit crap (I'd blame a lack of channels on the C64 for harmonies,
         but his amiga version is just as crap), and everyone else's C64 covers
         seem to cover his crap version, not the arcade version.  So, my
         version is crap too, but I think it has the nice harmonies in the
         second half, at least, and I think is a little less crap than his :)."

COMMENT: "After Sunset Sprirals, I was once again fed up with JCH's editor, and
         wanted something better.  Ray had suggested to me using TFX several
         times before, and I finally got some documentation for it, and so now
         was the time to use it.  I had the S3M of this kicking around, and so
         I covered it to learn the editor.  The instruments suck... I never was
         good at making percussion, and unfortunantly there isn't any good ones
         around made in TFX to rip.  I also had basically zero understanding of
         how the wave tables worked when I did this, and as a result there are
         some very stupid things in there which sound terrible ;).  This
         probably should never have been released, but people liked it for
         reasons that I don't understand.
         As it turned out, the instruments sounded so crap partially because
         Ray's player was horrifically bugged, at the time.  I recompiled it
         against a later player, and it sounds a LOT better." (JJ)

         didn't make the file much larger than it is.  It was a pain in the

         intended to be used in a demo with fishmagic, so I was going for that
         similar but different effect, and I think it worked very well.  But,
         ironically, I was never happy enough with the original fishmagic, or
         how the demo was turning out, so I gave this to Jazzcat for an issue
         of Vandalism News, for which it was much more suitable anyhow. I love
         this sort of song, why don't people do more of them?" (JJ)

COMMENT: "This was my entry for the 2004 SidWine competition, and it did
         fantasitcally badly, despite being what I consider to be probably the
         best demoscene style song that I've done on the C64.  I actually spent
         a lot of time on this song, and I was quite proud of how it turned out
         when it was finished.  It makes extensive use of the TFX wave table
         variables to try and squeeze two melody lines into a single channel,
         and the NoPulse command to control pulse width modulation reset more
         finely.
         The song is dedicated to a group I used to be a part of, Sonic Dreams,
         which is another story." (JJ)

COMMENT: "This is, musically, probably the best thing that I have ever done on
         the C64.  Ironically, all of my C64 friends complained that it was off
         key, etc, and all of my PC friends love this version.  Yet I had
         exactly the opposite reaction to the original version (c64 guys tended
         to like it, pc guys tended to complain that it was off key.).  For the
         record, except for one or two notes, because I ran out of arpeggios (I
         do that a lot... there are two or three other musics which got
         scrapped half way through because I ran out of arpeggios.  Thankfully,
         we've come up with a solution to this in the new version of TFX :)),
         the notes are NOT off key, and I don't care what you all think :-p.
         Said PC guys decided to take ownership of this song, and wanted me to
         create more like it, but I havn't had the motivation to actully
         finish any of them. (There are many, many, many stories that I could
         tell about the digiradi guys, but that's for another day, but the
         credit of the music to "Coder" is a part of that insanity.  They were

         were at one of his gigs, and he was tanking really badly (indeed, we
         could remember more of the words to his songs than he could!).  This
         was mostly because, we think, he was completly off the planet.  So, we
         came back to my place, after the gig, and I was showing off the new
         version of TFX, and we wrote the bass/chord/drum line (which is all
         one channel) to demonstrate some of the new features.  The file needed
         a name, and so we just typed in "Tim got high", and the name stuck.
         This song also has a lot of ring modulation (Joxstrap/WOW said too

         street in Manhattan. It was 8-bit with only 64KB of memory. Then I

         Midi-Workstation (8-track real-time Midi recorder) all by machine
         code using SuperMon without assembler so that it runs fast and leave

         5-inch floppy disk and manual. In 15 years, now we can buy 1GHz PC

         It demonstrates the output of my new audio encoder that produces
         output that is able to be decoded on the C64 using only a few raster
         lines per frame. It uses the free running SID oscillators on the C64's
         SID chip in 3 channels and a master volume to recreate the audio.
         Mainly suited for speech, but can also work on other sources. This
         demonstration packs a few minutes of audio into less than 47k and
         running in a C64 made in the early 80's with only 1MHz processor." (NK)

         disables the filter. This rip has the filter enabled.

         with it myself. Anyways, I had sent disks with a load of tunes on to
         all the major software companies at the time. Firebird contacted me,
         they wanted to use Icups. I told them at the time that it was kind of
         a rip off of Bogg's Detergent, but they were quite happy to offer to
         buy it. They offered me 150 pounds, and then when someone pointed out
         again to them that it was based on Bogg's tune, they gave him half the

         Postman Pat was another, and I'm damned if I can remember what the 3rd

         was also a member of at the time). According to Mark Kelly, the game
         was to be published by Hewson but due to licencing disagreements with
         Firebird (Sophistry being similar to Firebird's Zolyx) the game was
         cancelled.

COMMENT: "At a concert where Visa Röster interpreted both SID tunes and Swedish
         folk songs, my girlfriend and I bought a couple of CDs, and found a
         little gem called Allt under himmelens fäste that we both instantly
         liked. It's a very sad song with a simple melody, supported by a
         solemn yet rhythmical accompaniment written by Mahoney. If you're a
         SID composer, you know that when you get a song stuck on your mind,
         it inevitably ends up as a SID tune. =) In this case, I've tried to
         stick to Mahoney's arrangement as far as possible." (LA)

         Demobit'96, but as we all know that party was cancelled, so I had a
         tune without a destiny... Well, guess not as Jazzcat wanted it for
         Domination. It was used in the DOMINATION #8 outfit." (TH)

         then suddenly out of the blue an old AVT-project called 'Icarus'

         Odd, coz this tune is dedicated to Bjarne Riis (who?!) - after
         achieving 3rd place in the Tour de France in 1995... Who should've
         known he would win the darn race the year after... Oh well, this tune

         I converted this tune from a Walkman tune [Lets Hear My Baby] on

         What happened was that C64 sceners gathered round a TV-set with a
         blasting speaker and contributed songs were played. This tune, M&D's
         first release as a team, must have pleased the audience as it placed
         1st." (SA)
         Won first place at The Party 5 music competition.

COMMENT: Markus Müller composed all the tunes for the group Sidbusters.
         Sidbusters consisted of Markus along with Andras Molnár, nicknamed
         Andrew Miller (an English translation of his Hungarian name).  Andras'
         actual handle was Burton, and he made the music editor AMP which
         Markus used.

/MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/A_View_to_a_Coke.sid
  TITLE: Everlasting Love
 ARTIST: Robert Knight
COMMENT: This sid covers the 80's version by Sandra Cretu. "It was a great hit
         back in the 1980s, and a friend of mine made a bet, that I can't
         reproduce it with a C64, but I did... And I won a barrel of beer" (MM)

/MUSICIANS/M/Mueller_Markus/Coco_Intro.sid
COMMENT: Both Edwin van Santen and Markus Müller have claimed ownership of
         this tune, but due to the fact that Markus Müller vividly
         remembers even tiny details about it, and that Edwin van Santen
         never released any Soundmonitor tunes, it seems more likely it is in
         fact Müller's. Sadly, with Edwin van Santen having passed away, we
         may never know the complete story behind it.

         still have 40-50 disks lurking around somewhere. This short tune

         I don't know if they used any of the songs later on but as I can

         and badass turn-based sci-fi strategy, a bit similar to Laser Squad.
         All the source code was destroyed when zOnE's place burnt to dust in
         October, 1994. zOnE stopped writing games and I stopped writing C64
         music afterwards. Some riffs of Geister survived in my later band
         projects. This collection was onefiled by iAN CooG, packing together
         independent workfiles." (NP)

COMMENT: SW1.4 "It was one of the most challenging tasks I've ever done on

         and partly because I had extremely little time for the project
         because of album recording project I was working on at the time.
         So I created all the subtunes with a zero data separator part with
         a MIDI keyboard and DAW software Reaper as 3-channel MIDI, fed it
         with SWMconvert.exe and set the sounds. Instead of days the whole
         project was ready in an afternoon's time, all in all. I had to keep
         in mind from recordnig the first MIDI note that only a couple of
         blocks are allowed per subtune because of the memory limit. Due to
         planning, everything worked fine and it became the most efficient
         SID project I've done to date." (NP)

COMMENT: GT2.7 "This is an older worktune that I composed on guitar around

         My 'entry composition' for Avatar was a game tunes and FX pack. The
         ingame tune needed to be slow-flow and relaxed so I dusted off this
         one. Some time later I re-created it with Goat Tracker2 and expanded
         it to 3-channels (the gametune is 2-channels) and added a second
         part including heavy riffs. It wanted to release it at
         Revision 2012 but I missed the deadline as we arrived right after
         the oldschool music compo. So, it became released a little later at

         Some 20 years later in a CSDb thread it turned out that it was a
         Beastie Boys song that I could successfully avoid for such a long
         time despite the fact that I have a number of albums by them (not
         this one) and also watched them live here and there :) Thanks to
         Angel of Death for sorting this out! The SID was one of the short
         intro tunes that I gave to a guy called AERO to use in his intros.

COMMENT: "This tunes had been composed with the full player in mind (an loaded

         make use of pulse width modification.
         For the 'zero page version' of this piece, I had cut down the player
         to almost nothing in order to get a real short file with as little
         raster time as possible. During that step, I removed the routine for
         the pulse modification and increased the detuning of voice #2 and #3

         the bass sound from that piece. Anyway, I wrote this tune for

         single "Only With You" and on his album "Body To Body". Of course I

/MUSICIANS/O/Omoroca/Medusa.sid
COMMENT: "My first tune with digidrums, which I had ripped from the game
         "Danger Freak". This tune marks a turning-point in my personal
         development as a musician, putting the focus more on harmonies and
         elaborate arpeggios than trying to produce a "cool sound". From this
         tune on, I also made myself a strict rule that I FIRST finish

   NAME: Intro Tune
COMMENT: The tune falls out of synch at around 4:50, which is when the tune
         should loop. However, this is due to the music data in the game
         behaving exactly the same way. You would never get to hear this part
         of the tune in the game, as the intro would finish and load the first
         level before the music got to that point.
         "I guess I had some time pressure... I knew it would fade away
         anyhow... never thought about that fact that people in 2000 would
         listen to it with SIDPlay.... :)" (RO)
         The data has been restored in this SID, to make it loop properly,
         and is confirmed by Reyn to be correct.

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Access_Denied_intro.sid
COMMENT: "This was done very quick & dirty, if I remember right I've had only
         3-4 hours time to compose this track in our new developed and
         finished Reflex-Tracker, a 2 channel sampletracker. Access Denied
         sample spoken by me. The bass-drumm split was make with an Amiga 500
         and converted to my C64. Later in version v1.1 of Reflex-Tracker the
         user could do this without directly in the trakker. Funny: most of
         the time in this song I use only one digichannel, after release I
         created a remix which prooves the ability of Reflex-Tracker a little
         bit better. After winning the C64 democompo at THE PARTY'94 in
         Denmark, most of the people thought our group name is 'Access Denied'
         but it was 'Reflex' instead ;)" (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Access_Denied_remix.sid
COMMENT: "This is the remix of Access_Denied_intro.sid where I show some of the
         features of Reflex-Tracker: 2 channels of digi-sounds, faked third
         voice (drum and snare which are rendered in the bassvoice), volume,
         echoeffects and flanger. All samples by me, except the "ho ho" which
         I have sampled from the german rap song 'Edelweiß'." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Africa_Corps.sid
COMMENT: "Interesting fact: it's a 2 channel digi music but not a
         Reflex-Tracker tune. It's a routine which allows you theoretical add
         3 SID voices. The music editor is named 'Perfect Sound 3.2'.
         Unfortunately the 2 digi voices have always the speed (and pitch) of
         the first digi voice and if you really use both voices the SID
         channels were nearly destroyed and the CPU was down...
         We used this track in the note file of our (Reflex) first trackmo
         'Cafe Odd'. Later it became a very nice practice for us to use always
         a very special notefile-soundroutine for our trackmos.
         All (!) samples was sampled with my Phillips-Workman!!
         Sample-software by Zork and TTS! Sampler by Zork's Brother." (PVCF)

COMMENT: "My second doublespeed tune. After all the other conversions of this
         great song I thought it was a good idea not only to use the original
         melody. The great mood with the sfx and sounds should even be copied.
         At 2:01 I started to remix the song with some special drums and
         clave sticks." (PVCF)

COMMENT: "If you are using a old sid chip or emulation you will probably not

         $31 waveform. Sorry for that. Doesn't know much about this song, its
         15 years ago and this song was only made just 4 fun and to learn...
         I never planned to release this song (and during composing this I
         even didn't have the ability to do this^^)" (PVCF)

  TITLE: px.bladeswede remix! [from the Amiga game Project-X]
 ARTIST: Allister Brimble
COMMENT: "I listened to Allister Brimble's great song on Amiga and decided that
         this song has to be remixed to the C64. Unfortunately I don't have
         the needed amount of channels so I used a big bunch of arpeggio-lead
         & bass-splits. The patterns looks like a exploded memorydump, it was
         very hard to compose this with a durationeditor (DMC4.x). I really
         forced the lead melody between the arpeggios. The music got used in
         Access Denied trackmo-notefile with a raytraced animation and a
         layered scroller. Regarding our tradition to use some special in our
         trackmo-notefiles I tried a faked 4 speed tune, that means: normal
         doublespeed routine and additionally I called the sidroutine 2 times
         (without the filterroutine), that gives: 4speed wave and 2speed
         filter." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Brainbeat_3_Introrap.sid
COMMENT: "Again a Reflex-Tracker song, the rap and the beats are realtime
         mixed. Rapped by myself ;) The string was ripped from Georg Brandt's
         Paranoia_Complex.sid, Tune #1, thanks to Georg! As I've made this tune
         I thought it would be a revolution, the first realtime rap on C64 and
         so... but no one, I repeat: no one! cared about ;) Later I composed
         a very long CBA&Nightshade hate hip-hop track, (they have stolen and
         cracked a game which we have made), but this song was never spread by
         our swapper Happymaker. Very sad.)" (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Breitbandkatze.sid
COMMENT: "This is one of the few songs which I have made in our own sid-editor
         called LSD (Low Sound Dealer, IIRC). Nothing special here, I think I
         have composed this tune mustly to show what clear filter sounds are
         possible with this routine. It's a single speeder. Unfortunately I
         didn't know the trackmo (Breitbandkatze / Reflex) and the demo parts
         during composing. You need a new sidchip, or you will miss some
         complete channels. It's possible that this tune is the track, which I
         would do just for fun with the goal that no voices are listenable on
         a old sid chip. But I'm not sure if I realy have done this, its not
         very hard to do such things ;) (my intention: all my filtereffects
         sounds horrible on a old sid and I thought it was better to show
         listeners with old sid nothing than crap) it was the last song which
         I did on C64 after 5 years of sid composing. Since 2001 and now
         (2008) I rarely compose sidtunes with QuadraSID, one or two times per
         year. Some of this tracks you can download from my website as mp3
         (www.reflex-studio.com)" (PVCF)

         as the game was finished and the music was put in and I played it,
         I noticed: "shit, I've made the first ingame musics very very long,
         2-5 minutes each and the players died after some seconds of playing!"
         That was a very harsh lesson. Oh, and the game sold horrible...

         it in Polonus' DigiTracker and added the samplesequences. Very
         funny way to compose: if you changed a sample, for example after
         2 min in songlength, you have to start the song from begin to check
         if it works in minute two. I was very masochistic those days.

         table in his DMCs. From DMC4 I used a own table, which
         KB/TOM/farbrausch has edited. From 2:30 min there are very nice

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Dresden_Party_95_II.sid
COMMENT: "This song was composed live on a local computerparty. I would say it
         was funny, but on other had: how funny is a party where you sit down
         and work on a C64 and there is only one of this machine running and
         other people (Ron Grahnert aka Odysseus) are even bored and tried to
         get his hands on the keyboard? So we found a compromise and worked
         10 min each on DMC :) That's the result!
         Ah, one interesting thing: it's a special more and halfspeed-mix. One
         channel (arpeggio channel) is halfspeeded and the other 2 channels
         are massive multispeeded (did I mention that it was very bored at this
         party ? ;) For exact details about the routine you can simply
         watch the partydemo which was released together with BrainBeat 4,
         called Party Dresden 95. If you find out that it sounds different in
         the demo; that's right. However the tune in HVSC sounds as I've

COMMENT: "The task: compose a absolut High Quality techno song for the intro of
         our AFLI game :) I think its my best techno song on C64, it's a
         doublespeeder which really forces the 8580 to its limits. The ingame
         songs are simple singlespeeders, but I've spent much time in editing
         filter LFOs to get those clear and hard sounds on DMC3. IIRC the coder
         (Quiss) gave the tester of a german C64 mag called "64'er" a call and
         asked him to use a new sid chip for the review of the game. I got 10

COMMENT: "Very funny story why I created this song: if you look carefully in
         this directory you will find a song called "Axel_F" which I adapted
         from Harold Faltermeyer. I found out, if I play the original Beverly
         Hills Cop chords from Axel F in the other direction OR simultaneously
         it's exact(!) the same like "The Great Giana Sisters, Tune #5".
         To answer all other game related questions: NO!  :)
         It was NOT a Giana/Mario-clone. It was NOT released. I have NO copy
         (only one level was finished and playable, ask Quiss!) We do NOT have
         had a permission to use the name and the sprites of Giana :) The idea:
         what do if you get stressed by work / family / girlfriend/... ? What
         about a game where you can shoot very brutal? What enemy would you
         like to kill to vent your anger? Right! The dinky Giana Sister :p
         And what weapon would you like to use to kill Giana? Right! A tank! So
         here is the game: you have a tank with a machinegun which drove from
         right to left (on your will) and from above it was raining little
         Giana Sisters with parachutes. Now you could use your heavy machinegun
         and blow them into hell (subtune #6!). If you missed one and landed in
         front of you, you could try to drive with your tank chain over Giana :)
         then #5 was played. If you only have destroyed the parachute and
         little Giana falls & hit the ground #4 was played. #7 if a Giana hits
         your tank (and eats some of your health)." (PVCF)

COMMENT: "The sid music and the digisequence was composed with two different
         routines; DMC3 and Polonus' DigiTracker. Very funny way to compose:
         if you changed a sample, for example after 2 min in songlength,
         you have to start the song from begin to check if it works in min 2.
         I was very masochistic those days. Polonus did NOT include a fast
         forward routine, so I added one in his editor.
         The samples: for track 1 I used some placeholder voices (bad man,
         sumba-he!) just to see if the spoken samples work, after some months
         of work on this game and the decision that we do not release the game

         I composed this track. The result is one of the most styled intros
         ever (I hope ;) ). I worked on this tune for about 7 months (no joke)
         The complete intro from mathematica was supposed to be the intro of
         Access Denied one year before. But it didn't got finished so we added
         the 2 channel samplepart in front of Access Denied. Zorc has worked

         tracks. in this routine I could trigger demoparts with numeric
         commands in the soundpattern, Quiss (the programmer of LSD and some
         of the trackmoparts in Mathematica) have included a fallback routine
         in the demo, that waits 10 sec if the floppydrive of the user is to
         slow and a trigger was missed. Unfortunately he forgot to tell me that
         the first numeric trigger he was expecting was a "0". But I began the
         count with "1" ... so 10 sec failbackpause is in all versions of
         mathematica, right before the Doom-part. Funny thing: exact 5.34 min
         long was the centerpart, I composed exact 5.34 min :)  but I don't
         know about the 10 sec fall back routine, and Quiss didn't tell me...
         he simply took notice that the music was too "short", removed the
         stop-bytes at the end of the LSD track and was satisfied. Watching
         the trackmo first time and live at THE PARTY'95 I was pissed of as
         I saw/heard the result: the music wild remixed itself after 5.34
         unless the last part was finished. I learned one thing:
         (its true up to now, 2008!!) programmers don't have any savvy about
         music.  Last funny thing: I asked all people around me what they
         thought about this crazy and disharmonic music?  All(!) comments
         sounded like this: "If PVCF compose like this it has to be like
         this" ... aha.. ha ..ha... Funny thing: after the democompetition
         the organizers have shown this trackmo again, in this time (1995)
         Mathematica was like a revolution on C64 in design & code and I
         put in at 1:36 a little irish sounding melody which forced some
         people with hooked arms to dance together on tables, I was very
         very very proud :p  It's possible that you need a new sidchip to
         hear this part, sorry for that. (yes, the trackmo has a

         I worked on Megasweet a whole day and I swear, it was twice as good
         as what you can hear now. But after about 8 hours of composing on my
         C64 (it was a sunny day, I ought to learn for my A-level examination)
         the C64 was freezed (a DMC-crash which occured about once per year).
         After that I was so frustrated that I released this truly unfinished
         version. Check out the great mp3 conversion from DJ SKITZ. To be
         honest I have ripped out the idea for the filtered glide effect in
         the main bassline from an Amiga-mod called "Megasweet". I thought
         it would be nice to try something similar on C64 for testing purpose.
         Then I added the chord, but didn't play it as arpeggio-sound (typical
         C64), instead I played it like a triad, very slow and voila - the
         base idea of the first real trance/chill techno music on C64 was
         born. Now the "work" begun: in DMC4 doesn't exists a filtercommand
         in pattern, so I must use different filtered basses and endless
         glide-effects in bassline. It's not much fun to work like this." (PVCF)

         [It won the X'95 demo competition held in Utrecht, Netherlands]
         Quiss told me it was shown with a old sid chip 6581 and the music
         wasn't that what it should be supposed to, but the crowd was so
         impressed by the trackmo that the applause during the whole demo
         was even louder than the sound equipement. So the old sid wasn't
         that much of a problem :)
         It's a DMC music and I hate it for the 16 slots instrument
         limitation, you can hear it: the filter doesn't sweep smooth at the
         first part, they are like triggered in a mod file. :( Later I
         released this song in one of our Brainbeat music collections, but
         I forgot to relocate the song, so every one could load the tune
         directly in his DMC. The result: some very bad remixes (which uses
         this horrible filter off-set soundsystem). The party [the demo was
         released on] had a limitation in length of demos: 5 minutes. So first
         I composed the music as a 5 minutes track. Unfortunately Quiss (the
         coder of the trackmo) didn't get enough parts in time to fill up
         the 5 minutes complete. We first have planned to show during the
         whole demo a backward timer which runs from 5 min to 0 with the
         comment "We hate timelimits!!!". After Quiss told me the lack of a
         needed last part I shortened the music drastically. I have done this
         track on a new sidchip, KB/TOM (now farbrausch) later converted

         10 min remix of the original 4 channeled 'To Be on Top' by Chris,
         so I don't gave much effort in this DMC -sid only mix." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Trance_202.sid
COMMENT: "The second Reflex-Tracker demosong, this song was released with
         Brainbeat 4 on SideB. It shows some volume effects and wave/drum
         splitting." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Trance_HQ.sid
COMMENT: This tune was composed on an 8580 with a digi booster installed.
         "The samples was ripped from Jeroen Tel, Rob Hubbard/Simon Nicol
         and Chris Hülsbeck IIRC. One of my countless rockmonitor songs.
         I composed about 8-9 months with some versions of Hülsbeck's
         Soundmonitor and Rockmonitors and similar composing programs.
         I made about 30-40 songs with digis, no one was released!
         In 1997 I gave this bunch of disks to Happymaker, together with tons
         of disks with samples... only this song and Game_Over.sid are left,
         which I found later (1999) on a disc which was in a 1541 drive which
         I plugged on my PC just to look if I can use StarCommander to
         transfer stuff from a C64 disc to a harddrive." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/Triage_tune_2.sid
COMMENT: "This is one of the few songs which I have made in our own sid-editor
         called LSD (Low Sound Dealer, IIRC). Released and used in trackmo
         'Triage' by Smash Designs. I don't know if it is a multispeeder,
         but it sounds like a double speed DMC so it's possible that it is a
         normal speeded LSD where I wanted to prove what's possible with this
         great soundroutine." (PVCF)

/MUSICIANS/P/PVCF/execute_overdrive_intro.sid
COMMENT: "I was very surprised in 2004 as I heard this track in a new Smash
         Designs trackmo. Hm, I stopped composing on C64 in 1997 and in 2004
         there appears a new song... what happened? After analyzing the chords
         and melodies it was clear: it must be a working track, maybe a loader
         tune for centric. AEG, which is the lead programmer of Smash Designs,
         has the permission (since 1995) to use all PVCF-C64 songs on all C64
         productions and so he did :) I'm not sure, but I think he used more
         of my musics in his trackmos than we could in Reflex ;) Ah, AEG, if
         you care (and if you read this) : I've really planned in 1992(?)
         (after your first demo (bei nebenwirkungen essen sie die
         packungsbeilage...)) to ask you if I could join Smash Designs, no
         joke! But in those times my musics were so bad that I waited and then
         I got an offer from Reflex." (PVCF)

COMMENT: "This tune is 100% by me, but I made this zak for a competition where
         the musician have to be there to compete. So I gave the tune to CDAW
         and he competed with this track in the competition under his handle.
         The credits for CDAW are false. It's my tune but the player on the
         compo which are released with the song shows his name. Songcollection
         'Brainbeat 1', which surely have included the song (ed: in the note)

         full of this tune - it was used in nearly all notes on the disk

         version, since I had an 800XE before C64. Anyway the C64 version is

         since I didn't have PC yet) - it took me only 1 day and it's nearly
         the same as the original. Made in February 1997. Sounds the best on

         of free memory, so I had to chuck out all the effects modules in my

COMMENT: Tapeloader tune in Retrograde is slightly different from the disk
         version found in /MUSICIANS/R/Rowlands_Steve/Retrograde.sid, Tune #2.
         "The disk version was the original version of this tune. While
         mastering the game, the cassette loader would always hang at the
         "pause" in the music (the point where everything stops for a moment,
         listen for this at 1:31). They tracked this down to the pause in the
         music and thus the cassette loader uses a slightly different tune
         which doesn't stop." (Comment by Andrew Roberts)

         that you only would remember 2 things after having seen the demo: the
         music and the name RAMBONES. :) What a hoax, Kaze got his software
         from me, and me and TSN visited Wizz every weekend. There's some
         really nice filter in this one, so try a C64." (JH)

COMMENT: "That's exactly what my emotions were as I used this tune in my last
         demo, on the last screen. It was the Dexion-party in 1988. I had
         released 'Apolloguys' the same day, and I had bought my Amiga 500 only
         2 weeks before coming to this party. The first screen featured 'Like
         Galway', and me writing a lot of text about who and what 'rambones'
         was. The middle screen was the 'Amiga Noid' screen, with a small
         picture of an Amiga, and a scroll telling that TST would soon rule it.
         The last one, with this music, was a 10 point list of things about the
         C64 that bored the hell out of me. Things like colorbars, sprites
         moving in sinus, Hubbard alike drums/routines, all with the same sound
         and generally everything that was in at that time. For me it was sad
         to see a large variety of composers using more or less the same
         routine, leaving the music in a grey state. I admire the sound of Fred
         Gray, Martin Galway, Rob Hubbard, David Whittaker, Ben Daglish and
         Antony Crowther, and any other programmer that built it all up from
         scratch." (JH)

         picture to Hewson. They replied: your music is quite good, but we
         cannot accept you as a graphics-artist, the picture lacks all kind of

         first laid my hands on Soundmon. I didn't know at all how to use this
         program, but I could hear from Chris' and Banana's music that it
         definately was the way to go. So I asked Banana for some help. He sent

         Soundmonitor, and, not to my surprise, of course he was much better

         like this, as did he, but there's hardly any bass in it, because I try

         I had just learned FLD, 8-9 months after everybody else, but at least
         I didn't just rip it. I started on several tunes at the same time, to
         try and get them all to sound as they came from one whole, like Mike
         Oldfield does. This was the first one, but I never finished ZM4, I was
         too bored after all." (JH)

/MUSICIANS/S/SIDwave/Scary_Dreams.sid
COMMENT: "Nothing scary here. I think it got the name because of the
         atmosphere. Do go to a C64 with this! The main force in this tune is
         that I use all 3 voices for melody and no stupid drums. It almost
         sounds as if I designed the tune? No I didn't, almost anything just
         came out by itself." (JH)

         one of my friends, trying to teach him about using Soundmon. It was
         made in about half an hour, then I had to go on to another friend.
         I was so busy, driving around on my moped, dumping demos/games, and
         then on to the next. Finally, every evening, I would end up at TSN's

COMMENT: "A friend of mine programmed the game and he wanted a disco title

         ever seen a jumping spring at a disco ? So I composed a tune where
         everybody could imagine something about springs by listening to the
         music with closed eyes. [Two] days before release date of his game I
         gave him the tunes and he was really angry. But there was no other
         [option so he had to accept] my music, he he he !! I think he's still
         angry about that." (MS)

COMMENT: "All these tunes were written in 1990 for my design group by a
         friend called Arkadiusz 'Smart Monkey' Zych. They leaked from another
         friend of mine, Pawel 'Polonus' Soltysinski, who received them from
         me in 1991. Polonus was a member of Padua at the time. Neither me nor
         Arkadiusz was informed about them being used in C64 productions.
         Some of those compositions - orginally written for SID - were later
         used by Arkadiusz in his commercial, non-computer related ventures"

COMMENT: "Called 'Acid Stomach' because the sound at the every fourth bar
         sounds a bit like someone vomiting... well, that's what I thought,
         anyway. Again, not exactly what you'd call 'a nice tune' but I was
         just seeing what you could do with a few basic sequences by mixing and
         transposing them. At the time I didn't really like 'acid' music, I was
         more likely to listen to John Cage or Pierre Henry, so I wasn't really
         sure how to write it. SoedeSoft editor again. Horrible drums again,
         the snare being a bit like the one in Thalamusic." (BH)

COMMENT: "This tune does exactly what it says on the box, basically trying to
         get a ring-mod effect that sounded like an electric guitar being left
         leaning on a Marshall amplifier turned up to 11. I was fairly pleased
         with the result, it sounds quite uncomfortable on headphones. The tune
         was written on a SoedeSoft editor, which explains the rather fuzzy
         triggering and messy drum sounds, but gliding and filter control was
         much more versatile than anything else around at the time, I felt, and
         you could sustain notes for about 5 hours. The tune was not written
         especially for the "Acid At The PC Show" demo, having being composed
         around 8 weeks earlier, but Shane (coder) wanted to use them." (BH)

         SoedeSoft (I think) at 5am on the Sunday morning of the 1989 PC Show
         in London (hence the demo title). Has a long ending after a drum solo
         that John Bonham would probably laugh at. I also did a version of this
         tune in Ubiks Music in 1988, which was even worse. I hope that's never
         found!" (BH)

         and this is one of my very favourite C64 tunes ever. It was never
         meant to be released but we ended up sticking in on an SG demo disk
         anyway. Note that one of the arpeggios is a bit wonky, and I couldn't
         be bothered to do the start of the piece, but I felt that it was a
         pretty good sound-a-like." (BH)

COMMENT: "Another day, another pointless budget game. Yogi Bear deserved
         better! I can't remember if I composed the tune or if it was a
         conversion of some Atari ST music, written by some bloke who's name I
         can't remember. We used to do a few conversions back then. These were
         great fun to do. The software company would sent Gerard Gourley a copy
         of the original music, usually recorded on a cassette recorder sitting
         by the TV. He'd then play the tune down the telephone to me, and I'd
         record it on another cassette from the telephone's earpiece. The
         resulting hi-fidelity master recording would then be my basis. I
         usually had to guess at the basslines, as they'd become totally
         inaudible on the tape. Then I'd U-U the result back to Gerard within 2
         hours, and if I was lucky I'd get £100 about 6 months later after the
         'middle man' had taken his bit. Or half that if the tune was for
         Ocean." (BH)

COMMENT: "Composed for another dodgy budget game, in the old SG editor I think,
         which was written by Andy Lumley. I probably had about 12 hours notice
         to write this... Zzap reviewed it and called it siren 'music', so they
         can't have listened to more than about 10 seconds of it. I quite liked
         it at the time, but more for the effects than the rather scrappy lead
         lines. Tune #4 was totally different in style, for the hiscore table.
         The main tune seems to be bugged near the end - this must have
         happened when the file was inserted into the game, it was OK when it
         left me. To be honest, music for this sort of game was an afterthought
         - and for the money I was getting, I wasn't about to try and write an
         epic!" (BH)

COMMENT: This tune falls out of synch at around 4:28. However, the game does
         this also due to a bug in the programmers' code as Ben mentions.

         in 1990 at the height of the Madchester/Baggy craze. I got sick of

         really impressive body of work, eh? No wonder I never made it as a pop

COMMENT: "Some people claim that everything imaginable has been done on the C64.
         This is true to a certain extent. The typical scenario is indeed that
         you come up with something new just to find out that someone else has
         done it 10 years ago... But sometimes strange things happen and even
         lamers like myself stumble on new stuff. This happened when we were
         working on our 4k intro Pico! for Breakpoint this year. I was coding
         the music player and tried to create some drum sounds when I
         accidentally got some harsh, very distorted sounds. The funny thing
         was that I was using the noise waveform and got something that sounded
         like a synthesized electric guitar!" (SounDemoN)

/MUSICIANS/T/Taylor_Stuart/Sky_Runner.sid
COMMENT: "I had been commissioned by Orpheus Software (ironically the makers of
         Electrosound) to code the music for their game Sky Runner. They sent
         me a work-in-progress version of the game along with a
         sort-of-completed Electrosound composition. They wanted me to
         transpose this to a non-Electrosound version and make it my own - what
         you hear on here is the end result. Unfortunately the MD of Orpheus at
         the time was a complete nightmare to work with - I was young and naive
         at the time but this was my first experience, commercially, of trying
         to get money out of someone. He just wouldn't pay - kept saying cheque
         would be in the post, give it another week or so etc etc....looking at
         Sky Runner for the first time ever (on here) it looks like the
         programmer's deal with Orpheus went pretty sour as well. I see the
         game was published by another software house (Cascade?) and the music
         had gone back to it's original Electrosound composition - obviously I
         had no dealings with Cascade - they probably didn't even know about my
         arrangement!!.... About 1 year later, under new management, Orpheus
         approached me again asking me to do some more music. OK, I said,
         firstly you pay me for Sky Runner and secondly I want the money for
         the new music (I think it was an adaption of some board game involving
         moving buses around London???) up front - they obliged so there was a
         happy ending to this story." (ST)

         seemed to be wondering if I *really composed Bad Blood*. The answer is
         yes with a capital Y.
         Charles Deenen said it was the "best music I made on C64" when I
         finished it. (I do NOT agree ofcourse, although I must say it's the
         best "filmscore" soundtrack I've done for a game on the C64. I
         actually got some kind of filmscript for it, that's why I could be
         very specific when composing themes for characters and events in the

/MUSICIANS/T/Tel_Jeroen/KOUD_HE.sid
COMMENT: This tune was the original prototype for the title theme from Savage.
         Jeroen did this first, sampling the Dutch comedian Harry Vermeegen.
         'Koud he' was his catchphrase and translated it means 'Cold eh?'.
         His most notorious use of this was a Dutch TV programme called 'Pisa'
         (filmed from the leaning tower) with Harry saying his 'Koud He?'
         catchphrase to everyone that went by. Probe Software then heard the
         tune and asked Jeroen if he'd change the samples, and lo and behold it
         became the Savage theme.
         "Some background info. The 'KOUD HE' sample is from a Dutch comedian
         called 'Harry Vermeegen'. It was like a hype saying. I found it a nice
         sample to play around with. A spontanious tune I did just 4 fun." (JT)

         silly 'BURP!' and 'AJIIRK' too. My brother was pushing me to go with
         him, so I asked him to sample some voices real fast. (in this case,
         rather silly ones.) This is probably the most 'rushed' music I've ever
         made. (which shows somehow). I like many of the ideas in it, but I
         just had to meet the deadline. No time for quality checks... just...
         PRODUCE and DELIVER. Too bad somehow. It give us a funny compilation
         of brainactivity though :O
         BTW: If you want to know my brother's name: It's 'Kees Tel' (he's an
         awesome composer and musician. He composes almost any imaginable style
         of music and plays a LOT of instruments.)" (All comments by JT.)

         EUROPE was never finished (at least not the first version). I don't
         know why/when/where/how.
         Then Turbo Outrun was made. (you know the music, etc.) One of the two
         title-tunes (not the 1.2.3. hit-it! one) was actually composed for
         Outrun Europe.
         OUTRUN EUROPA in 1990 is a totally different game from the old
         unfinished, never released game in 1988/1989." (All comments from JT)

         different game from Outrun Europa, released in 1991. The first two

COMMENT: "Walker's Warbles" was a Martin Walker music demo which came as a free
         giveaway with the disk version of "Armalyte" by Thalamus (which MW did
         the music for.) Tune #3 is an early version of what would eventually be
         used in the game "Dominion" bundled on a Zzap! 64 covertape in 1990,
         and tune #4 is an early version of the "Aggressor Theme". The final
         version of this (and the one which Revolution uses) is the one on MW's
         "Zzap! 64 Music Demo" which appeared on Zzap 64's June 1989 covermount
         cassette. (Comment by Warren Pilkington)
(#4)
COMMENT: This tune was also used in a game called Revolution (written by Simon
         Pick). The game was never released, but featured on Commodore Format
         magazine's powerpack (tape) number one.

  TITLE: Action Biker, Tune #1
 ARTIST: Rob Hubbard
COMMENT: "This is a remix from Rob Hubbard's Action Biker main theme (tune #1)
         from the year 1985! (C) Mastertronic. Listen to the original and hear
         the difference! I first typed over the notes (bass + lead) from a Music
         Assembler example tune. Not using the ugly percussion track. The
         chords are typed over from a Midi file called Biker. (Lazy me eh?!).
         Maybe this will not be necessary in future because there is a Midi to
         Mod program and buddy Roland Hermans has made a Mod to Sid program.
         I'm not quite happy with this tune because of the weak 2 notes
         arpeggio part (from 1:14 to 1:50). I made the volume of this arpeggio
         part a bit softer so it becomes a bit less annoying. Maybe I will
         improve this tune sometime. Same presets used as in Rolfie Title
         Remix. Typing over the notes took some amount of time (I always work
         slowly!). I used too many sequences in the 2nd track (it can only
         handle 128). So Roland Hermans "packed" several sequences into only a
         few so the player can handle them. This is the 2nd tune for mainly
         Polish based group Axelerate. Tune is played at CIA 1 Timer A (PAL)
         because we wanted another speed than a normal one. Tune has nice
         ending, don't you agree? Hope you like it!" (JW)

         want to listen to frequently perhaps even like a good 80s game sid.
         Soon I noticed I had too few good ideas myself so I used some
         "borrowed" music in this one in true Rob Hubbard style (he also covered
         a lot as you know). So some of other composer's music was the basis of
         some tunes varied with own ideas and combinations of these 2. Of course
         Roland Hermans (Neo) helped me with the technical bits." (JW)

   NAME: Intro Tune

         simple to do and still sounds great. The combination with the Matrix
         tune works well I think. Also I listened to a lot of hard rock/heavy
         metal music to get inspired. A lot of what Matt Gray did can be
         identified with this style. Using double bass plus MG drums is a good
         combination plus after that a ring modulation lead sounds nice." (JW)
(#3)
   NAME: Massive Attack
COMMENT: "Massive Attack begins with 2 tracks shooting SFX from the game
         Dominator. Then a Star Wars alike film tune. The piece after that the
         Jon Dunn's Robocop lead instrument fits and sounds so well! Some funny
         kicks and snares in different volumes. The last piece is very short 'n
         simple and still sounds good. Only a few sequences used. About 4 if I
         remember well." (JW)

   NAME: Arduous Battle
COMMENT: "Arduous Battle is completely done by me. In a lot of places the bass

         composed on the Amiga with Protracker which was called Freedom. What I

         fantastic stretched arpeggios in it. The break in this part is my
         friend Roland's favourite (You know him from the PSID64 program). And
         the last part is composed by myself using some Galway  Rambo tune #5
         instruments which I made a bit harder volume wise. Oh yes the
         instrument of the arpeggios is an enhanced version of Jason Brooke's
         Bismarck arp. preset." (JW)

   NAME: Space Explorer
COMMENT: "Space Explorer has a very mysterious intro. As you can hear Philip

         2 tracks and play them slightly over eachother. Always sounds very
         good!" (JW)

         player is handy! Bit boring end of 1st part. I got tired of writing for

COMMENT: "The demo in which this sound was spread contained the full lyrics of
         the song written in South Dutch dialect. This tune consists of a
         double lead to get a sort of echo effect. The reason why I made this
         song: In the south of Holland we celibrate Carnival each year around
         the end of February and because I live in a provence of Southern
         Holland called Limburg I decided to make one of the best Carnival
         songs on the C64! During Carnival everyone dresses up in some strange
         costume and goes into pubs to party and of course drink a lot of beer.
         The title of the song translated into English is: When the stars are
         shining up there. Written in waltz tempo. Hope you like it." (JW)

  TITLE: press fire [from the Amiga game Shadow of the Beast III]
 ARTIST: Tim Wright
COMMENT: "Of course I had to squeeze the Amiga 4 tracks in to C64's 3. But the
         tune uses 2 tracks for the part which isn't the lead or bass. How do
         you call that part anyway? (backing?) While going through old Amiga
         500 games with buddy Roland (we were looking through because we are
         planning a C64 demo consisting converted Amiga pics in FLI-Interlace)
         we stumbled upon this tune. I like it very much so I tried if I could
         rip it with my Datel Electronics' Amiga Action Replay MK III. I froze
         the game and typed in tracker. And golly yes! The cartridge found the
         tune and I saved it to disc and loaded it in my Protracker soundtool.
         Together with Roland I converted it. (He works much quicker than me).
         We are planning to do more conversions. After this conversion Roland
         made a program to convert from MOD to SID, right into my player as
         I said in Action Biker Remix STIL text. But now it even converts
         arpeggios! The presets are: bass from Psycho Pigs UXB. Flute resembles
         Amiga lead sample instrument but has a little waveform 41 tick at
         the beginning and is made by Roland. Other preset is from Henning
         Rokling's Henning_Rokling-02.sid which is used in demo Wild At Heart.
         We first made an arpeggio sound consisting of two different c notes
         but it didn't work out well. In beginning of the tune you can hear a
         build up of decay and sustain in this preset. To get this effect we
         had to make 4 presets just changing the decay and sustain from 2 to 8.
         The wave on effects on bass and Rokling preset make it sound ok on
         C64. Often this effect is used to substitute normal hi hat sounds.
         This ditty is one of my favourite tunes!" (JW)

         taken from Demon's Aural Manouvers II. I listened to the original TV

COMMENT: "This is the high score tune. Before Forester this sound was published
         (slightly different from this one) as "Ode to Junior". Junior was a
         cat that we had at my elderly home. Was, because he's now in cat's
         heaven. Tune was made in a period I didn't know how to make use of
         arpeggio's (chord substitutes). It's still ok, I guess." (JW)
(#7)
COMMENT: "This is the bonus level tune. It's made a bit faster than the level
         tunes to get that hectic feel. Funny is the extreme fast part starting

          during the gfx compo. This was changed in comparison with
          last year's party. Bass preset is from a Boogaloo sound,
          Matt Gray drums were surprisingly not taken from one of

COMMENT: "Called sleeping song because Roland thought it was a song from which
         you get very sleepy. The chords are taken from the beginning of the
         music of a Dutch USA team demo called Nemesis, I made use of some
         sawtooth presets to get that Galway feel. Bassline is simply using a C
         note and the C note an octave higher. Made in Music Assembler which
         was shortened by pally Roland Hermans, so it only occupies memory from
         $1000-$12EF on the C64 which is 3 blocks (less than 1 K!). Neil
         Baldwin's Demonic-Part_1 was an example for me, using 2 tracks for
         lead when the bass is suspended. The nicest thing of the C64 sid chip

         jury on the Mekka party so if you know a lot of people who will vote
         for you, you will finish 1st. The first part (from 0:00 to 0:45) was
         made back in '92. The rest was made in 2 weeks in 2001. At the party
         sids are played up to 4 minutes. So I had to stop at the end of the
         4th minute. Since this msx contains a sample beat it must be played on
         an old sid, as was done on the party. You had to mention on the entry
         sheet which sid they had to use. Too bad the music was played too soft
         on the party (held during Easter). The zax might be a bit too

         and is about a cat which travels around the world visiting 10
         countries from which England and America are divided into 2 pages. So
         in total there are 12 different country drawings, a title page, a
         credits page and and end page. With every page there comes an
         appropriate, spheric music plus lyrics about what can be seen in the
         drawings. All the sight seeing objects can be seen in a picture of
         each country. For instance in Egypt you can see: some pyramids, a
         sphinx, the Nile, a palm tree, some background items and Rolfie the
         cat on a camel. When you click on an object it starts to animate and a
         WAV-file begins to play making e.g. a camel sound and telling a story
         about e.g. a camel. This title tune is apart from the melody altered
         heavily to let it sound ok on the C64. This is the first tune I made
         since 1992 which was spread, so you can call it a sort of test tune.
         And this is also the first tune made for mainly Poland based group
         Axelerate which has died in the beginning of 2001. All presets are the
         same as in Linko music except before every bass sound (from 0:15),
         there is a kick drum sound added. Idea for 3 track chords in beginning
         is from Reyn Ouwehand's Deadlock (brilliant title tune). Wind sound
         was added, as always if something needs to be added, it was done by

         the 1st. Thanx again to Neo for helping with the presets but in the

  TITLE: Air Combat (level 3) [from the Amiga game Turrican III]
 ARTIST: Chris Hülsbeck
COMMENT: "Another MIDI file conversion taken from the Video Game Music Archive
         (www.vgmusic.com). It was first intended to be a high score music for
         a shoot'em up from Protovision, but they didn't want covers in their
         games. Roland and I first put the filter on the arpeggios like Robocop
         title but in most cases it is best to put it on the bass like we did
         in this tune. I think this is one of the best basslines I ever heard.
         It's pretty complex! Chris is/was probably the best German computer
         zax composer ever. I think! The arpeggios are not chords they consist
         of 2 notes. Lead is from Dunn's Robocop title, rest by Roland. Hope U
         like it!" (JW)

  TITLE: Interlevel [from the Amiga game Turrican II]
 ARTIST: Chris Hülsbeck
COMMENT: "Big User of Protovision needed a quick, o.k. tune for his Vision 2002
         party entry called Mega Turrican (GFX). And that's what I did. That
         background preset thingie was taken from X-Out, which was used there
         as lead. Again a midi file was the basis for this one. From 0:50 an
         extra effect was added courtesy Roland. Thanx! I must say it sounded
         really cool on the party with that thumping bass! As you can hear the
         drums were linked to the bass." (JW)

COMMENT: It is based on an old French soldiers tune.
         "4 of the anthems I made were to be used in a farewell demo of
         Axelerate. The demo never was coded, so all the anthems were used in
         Arachnophobia diskmag. All anthems can be found in a cd rom
         encyclopedia as midi file. I took the dominant lead and the bass from
         the midi and searched for the second voice myself. Hope to hear this
         tune again in a World Cup soccer final one day!" (JW)

  TITLE: La Marseillaise (French National Anthem)
 ARTIST: Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle
COMMENT: "I first made this tune on the Amiga because it was easier in 1992 to
         use Protracker. It was meant for a C64 game Roland and I planned to
         make (Red Baron) which was never finished. The funny thing with the
         game was that you had to put the telly or monitor on its side! So you
         got an arcade feel to the game.  This tune was used in a note spread
         by JSL also from Protovision." (JW)

COMMENT: "It's a long time ago that I composed sounds for the good old C64. But

         My composing started in the years 1983/84 when I programmed my own
         music-editor and the music-play-routine. I made an extra-routine for
         each sound. From music to music I changed that routine to get
         different sounds.
         I have made some musics, good and bad sounds. But I have tried to make

  TITLE: Autumn
 ARTIST: Jori Olkkonen (Yip)
COMMENT: Another version of Yip's tune from Scroll Machine, played using a
         simpler music routine, because the original music routine interfered
         with the game's code: "I had to ask Jori to make the music with
         slightly less sparse synching, but when I did that the sound quality
         dropped a bit. The result was a bearable compromise. The screen
         glitches were almost gone and the music still sounds fairly good."

         MikroBITTI 4/87)
